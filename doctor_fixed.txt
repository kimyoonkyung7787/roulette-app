??Check that required peer dependencies are installed
Missing peer dependency: react-native-worklets
Required by: react-native-reanimated
Advice:
Install missing required peer dependency with "npx expo install react-native-worklets"
Your app may crash outside of Expo Go without this dependency. Native module peer dependencies must be installed directly.

??Check that no duplicate dependencies are installed
Your project contains duplicate native module dependencies, which should be de-duplicated.
Native builds may only contain one version of any given native module, and having multiple versions of a single Native module installed may lead to unexpected build errors.
Found duplicates for react:
  ?쒋? react@19.1.0 (at: node_modules\react)
  ?붴? react@19.2.4 (at: node_modules\moti\node_modules\react)
Advice:
Resolve your dependency issues and deduplicate your dependencies. Learn more: https://expo.fyi/resolving-dependency-issues
